# basic-informational-site

This is a basic informational site with a home, about, and contact page. There's also a 404 page when serving a page that doesn't exist. This project was meant as practice for creating a Node.js server file and serving the right page according to the URL.

Feel free to clone this repository and start the site on localhost by running `node index.js` on your terminal!
